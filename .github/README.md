# RowsWeekly

> What is RowsWeekly?

RowsWeekly is the repository for all the materials we share in RowsMeetup.

> Eh, RowsMeetup?

RowsMeetup is initially the meeting series for programming language [RowScript],
but now more and more topics are covered around general PLT and some other
languages toys:

* [RowScript], a purely functional JavaScript dialect
* [Cyrup], C with much sugar
* And yet some other elaboration zoos here...
